      <h1>Holiday MadLibs</h1>
      <p>'Twas the night before @Model.Holiday, when all through the house
            <br/>
      Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
            <br/>
      The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
            <br/>
      In hopes that St. @Model.Name soon would be there;
            <br/>
            <br/>
      The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
            <br/>
      While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
            <br/>
      And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
            <br/>
      Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,
            <br/>
            <br/>
      When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
            <br/>
      I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
            <br/>
      Away to the window I @Model.Action like a flash,
            <br/>
      Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
            <br/>
            <br/>
      The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
            <br/>
      Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,
            <br/>
      When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
            <br/>
      But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,
            <br/>
            <br/>
      With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
            <br/>
      I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
            <br/>
      More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
            <br/>
      And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;
            <br/>
            <br/>
      "Now, DASHER! now, DANCER! now, PRANCER and VIXEN!
            <br/>
      On, COMET! on CUPID! on, DONNER and BLITZEN!
            <br/>
      To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
            <br/>
      Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"
            <br/>
            <br/>
      As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
            <br/>
      When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,
            <br/>
      So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
            <br/>
      With the sleigh full of toys, and St. @Model.Name too.
            <br/>
            <br/>
      And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
            <br/>
      The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
            <br/>
      As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
            <br/>
      Down the chimney St. @Model.Name came with a bound.
            <br/>
            <br/>
      He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
            <br/>
      And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
            <br/>
      A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
            <br/>
      And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
            <br/>
            <br/>
      His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
            <br/>
      His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
            <br/>
      His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
            <br/>
      And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
            <br/>
            <br/>
      The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
            <br/>
      And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
            <br/>
      He had a broad face and a little round belly,
            <br/>
      That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.
            <br/>
            <br/>
      He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
            <br/>
      And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
            <br/>
      A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
            <br/>
      Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
            <br/>
            <br/>
      He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
            <br/>
      And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
            <br/>
      And laying his finger aside of his nose,
            <br/>
      And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
            <br/>
            <br/>
      He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
            <br/>
      And away they all @Model.Action like the down of a thistle.
            <br/>
      But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
            <br/>
      HAPPY @Model.Holiday TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!
